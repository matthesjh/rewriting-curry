# Libraries for term rewriting and narrowing in Curry

This package provides a representation of first-order terms and various notions of term rewriting, like positions, substitution, unification, critical pairs, etc. Moreover, it defines also operations for rewriting and narrowing strategies and a representation of definitional trees.

**Note:** A previous version of the contained libraries was part of the KiCS2/PAKCS distributions.
